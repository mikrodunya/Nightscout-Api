Here (the start of) a list of API endpoints.

    http://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/entries
    http://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/entries/current
    https://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/status (the JSON version has a lot more data)
    https://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/treatments (note that this returns JSON)
    https://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/profile.json (ditto)
    https://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/entries/sgv
    https://cgmtestt.herokuapp.com/api/v1/profile/current (note that this returns JSON)

To keep data costs down, some of these return Tab Separated Values (TSV) by default. If you'd like to retrieve JSON, then append .json to the end of your endpoint. For example:

    http://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/entries.json
    http://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/entries/current.json
    https://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/status.json (the non JSON version has a lot less data)
    https://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/treatments.json (note that the non JSON version also returns JSON)
    https://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/profile.json (note that the non JSON version also returns JSON)
    https://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/entries/sgv.json
    https://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/api/v1/profile/current (note that the non JSON version also returns JSON)

There is also https://cgmtest.herokuapp.com/report which allows you to generate reports from your data.
